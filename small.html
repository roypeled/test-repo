        <p>Developers and organizations alike are looking for a way to have more agility with mobile solutions. There is a desire to decrease the time from idea to test. As a developer, I often run up against one hurdle that can slow down the initial build of a mobile hypothesis: user management.</p>

        <figure><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/08/user-authentication-web-ios-apps-aws-cognito-part-1"><img src="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cognito-diagram-500w-opt.png" width="500" height="329" alt="User Authentication For Web And iOS Apps With AWS Cognito (Part 1)" /></a></figure>

        <p>Over the years, I have built at least three user management systems from scratch. Much of the approach can be based on a boilerplate, but there are always a few key items that need to be customized for a particular client. This is enough of a concern that an entire category of user management, authentication and authorization services have sprung up to meet this need. Services like Auth0 have entire solutions based on user and identity management that developers can integrate with.</p>	<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/08/user-authentication-web-ios-apps-aws-cognito-part-1/" class="cr">Read more...</a>
